  // To fix this problem
  &__content {

    // Now the width is 100% of the section, but it's covering even less of our section.
    // That's because it maintains the aspect ratio of this video.
    // To occupy more of our section but also to maintain the aspect ratio we can use
    // object-fit
    // Now, the element (the video) will fill the entire parent while still maintaining its
    // aspect ratio.
    // It's similar to having background-size set to cover, but instead of working with
    // background-image it works with HTML elements.
    // But it would work just the same with images. We can have one parent element and in
    // there an image, and then with object-fit we can make that image cover the parent
    // element.
